# **Physical Pattern Design Tool**
A microkeyboard that lets you generate 4 different types of pattern and control those pattern to achieve various results. I really liked how much you can do with the randomness effect in processing and I thought it would be interesting to have a microkeyboard that basically lets you controll that randomness, the values of the Sin Waves generated by processing.

### How it works
6 components - a potentiometer, slider and 4 switches/keys. These are all conected to an AtomS3 Board extention. and put in a 3D printed Box. The values of those 6 components are first read and mapped in [Thonny](./) and then the values that thonny has are read by [Processing](./) and later used to control the pattern values.
